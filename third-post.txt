Mr. Dursley was the director of a firm called Grunnings, whichmade drills. 
He was a big, beefy man with hardly any neck, al-though he did have a very large mustache. 
Mrs. Dursley was thinand blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck, 
whichcame in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning overgarden fences, 
spying on the neighbors. The Dursleys had a smallson called Dudley and in their opinion 
there was no finer boy any- where.
