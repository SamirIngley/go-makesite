They didn’t think they could bear it if anyone found out about thePotters. 
Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley’s sister, but they hadn’t metfor several years; 
in fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn’t have asister, because her sister and 
her good-for-nothing husband were asunDursleyish as it was possible to be. 
The Dursleys shuddered tothink what the neighbors would say if the Potters arrived in thestreet. 
The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, butthey had never even seen him. 
This boy was another good reasonfor keeping the Potters away; 
they didn’t want Dudley mixing witha child like that.
